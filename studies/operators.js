/*
* OPERATORS:
* 
* Assignment operators - Operators used for value storage
* 
* = assigning or reassigning 
* += adding to a value and then assigning the sum
* -= subtracting from a value then assigning the difference
* *= multiplying a value then assigning the product
* /= dividing by a value then assigning the results
* %= dividing by a value then assigning the remainder

*
* Arithmetic operators -  Operator used for math stuff.
* + addition
* - subtraction
* * multiplication
* / division
* % modulo (remainder of division)
*
* Comparison operators - Used for comparison of values
* > greater than
* < less than
* >= greater than or equal to
* <= less than or equal to
* === strict comparison (values must match exactly)
* == non strict comparision (values must match, but not exactly)
*
* Logical operators -  Simple comaprision operators based on booleans
* && and operator
* || or operator
* 
*
* Unary operators -
* typeof  returns data type as a string
* ! bang operator, essentially means "Not" 
* 
*
* Ternary operator: Specifically takes three operands and returns a boolean
* ?  a simplified way of comparing thing using true or false, with simpler
*  syntax than an entire loop.
